The games theme was inspired by old classic 2D sidescrolling games more evidently from the RPG genre like *Castlevania*.

## Contributions Guide

Equipo, **Porfavor lean** esto antes de hacer cualquier **pull request** y/o **push** al repositorio(si en ingles nimodo, la industria esta en ingles). Estoy tomando en consideracion que esta es probablemnte su primera vez utlizando github.

Team, **Please read** this before attempting any **pull request** and/or **push** into the repository. I am taking into consideration this is your first time using github.

#### Mini Github Tutorial Reminder

Your workflow must be divided into *two* steps:
1. Actual coding and editing files and/or images.
2. Creating git **commits**(saved points in the projects timeline).

At the end you're going to attempt to **push** your changes(**commits**) into the **repository** we all share online. Yet in this case you're going to create a **pull request**, a request to pull those **commits** into the **repository**.

- Git: local version control software used via the temrinal
- Github: Online service that works in conjuction with git

To use Git in your computer you're going to be using your *Terminal* application if you're working on a Mac and if you're working on a Windows you may and I reccomend downloading [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). (most Macs have preinstalled Git, GitBash is a terminal) 

1. Locate yourself from inside your terminal where you want to clone the **repository**, using the command `cd`. Ex. `cd documents/playground`. This is my folder where I keep my projects.
2. Clone the **repository** `git clone herGoesTheLink`, remeber to press the green button at the upper right conrer inside the github repository to get the link.
3. Change yourself from the default `master` branch to the `dev` branch, `git checkout dev`.
4. Do your coding & project contribution.
5. Stage your changes so git can recognize them for the commiting process. `git add .` (stages all files within your folder).
6. Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Commit messege"` 
7. Push your changes into the **repository**, `git push -u origin`.
8. Once your branch has pushed, make the pull request inside the github **repository**.

#### Contributions Guidelines

- From `dev` branch, checkout a new Branch with the command `git checkout -b type/branch_name`. Where type is a general idea of what's implemented. Ex. `fix`, `feature`, `enhancement`, etc.
- **Commits** messeges' must be precise and concise, *please*. Ex `git commit -m "Added mobility to character object"` or `git commit -m "Fixed wall jumping bug"`
- Grab an issue from the Github repo and try to fix it or something from the TODO list.
- Report issues & TODOs, **please**.
